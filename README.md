# Determinants-of-House-Price
Utilizing R, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Ames Housing Prices dataset, containing variables such as dwelling type, year built, lot area, and more. The primary aim was to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating house sale prices, thereby facilitating a nuanced understanding of market trends, demand dynamics, and investment opportunities while minimizing associated risks. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, the resulting model provides actionable insights that inform strategic decision-making processes.

I built many graphs prior to building my models to do some exploratory analysis and decide which variables I wanted to test. I created visualizations on the relationships between the independent variables, as well as between the independent and dependent variables.
